                        The importance of reading lot of books and being well versed in theory is well known among the left leaning community. Hence, to make an index, keep track, and have quick notes about the books, an article is dedicated to each of the books read/studied by us.

                        It must be noted that the articles in this blog are in no way a replacement of the actual book reading and we urge you to read the original book.
